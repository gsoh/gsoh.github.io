I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Michigan. I work on probabilistic models for autonomous driving and artificial intelligence. My research field lies at the intersection of machine learning, optimal control, and reinforcement learning. My recent works include generative models (e.g., normalizing flow and VAE) and prediction & planning of autonomous vehicles.

I spent the past summer interning at Amazon AI where I researched deep generative models for music generation using variational inference and normalizing flow. Earlier this year, I was a teaching assistant for the Machine Learning course (EECS545) at the University of Michigan. In 2019, I interned at Uber ATG where I worked on autoregressive flow and prediction models for autonomous driving.
