I am a software engineer at Google. At Google, I develop ML/AI models and platforms for automatic speech recognition. I recently earned my Ph.D. degree at the University of Michigan where I worked on probabilistic ML models for autonomous driving and AI applications. My PhD research focused on generative models (Normalizing flow, VAE, and Transformers) and applications of them for AI applications including autonomous driving (prediction & planning) and sequence predictions.

In Summer 2021, I was a PhD intern at Google and developed a Transformer-based non-autoregressive neural sequence model for NLU. In Summer 2020, I interning at Amazon AI where I researched deep generative models for music generation using Transformer and variational inference. In early 2020, I was a teaching assistant for the Machine Learning course (EECS545) at the University of Michigan. In 2019, I interned at Uber ATG where I worked on autoregressive prediction models and normalizing flow for autonomous driving.

## Favorite Quote
[Quote from Interstellar (2014)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WzHXI5HizQ):  <em>"We've always defined ourselves by the ability to overcome the impossible. And we count these moments. These moments when we dare to aim higher, to break barriers, to reach for the stars, to make the unknown known. We count these moments as our proudest achievements. But we lost all that. Or perhaps we've just forgotten that we are still pioneers. And we've barely begun. And that our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us, because our destiny lies above us."</em>
