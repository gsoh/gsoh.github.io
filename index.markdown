I am a research engineer at Google DeepMind. My current interest includes AI agents, LLM post-training, and generative models. I am a core contributor of Gemini Deep Research and I have worked on reasoning, planning for tool/extensions for LLMs. Previously I worked on self/semi-supervised i18n models for automatic speech recognition and deliver them to the partners such as Pixel, Assistant, Youtube, and Google Cloud. 

I earned my Ph.D. degree at the University of Michigan where I worked on generative AIs and decision-making under uncertainty. My PhD research focused on generative models (Normalizing flow, VAE, and Transformers) and learning-based planners (model-based RL, optimal control, as well as some model-free RLs), mainly in the context of autonomous driving (prediction & planning) and sequence prediction applications (e.g., NLP). In early 2020, I was a teaching assistant for the Machine Learning course (EECS545) at the University of Michigan. 

During my PhD, I did an internship at Google where I developed a Transformer-based non-autoregressive neural sequence model for natural language processing. I also interned at Amazon AI (AWS AI) where I researched deep generative models for music generation using Transformers. In 2019, I interned at Uber ATG where I worked on autoregressive generative models and normalizing flow for autonomous driving.

## Favorite Quote
[Quote from Interstellar (2014)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WzHXI5HizQ):  <em>"We've always defined ourselves by the ability to overcome the impossible. And we count these moments. These moments when we dare to aim higher, to break barriers, to reach for the stars, to make the unknown known. We count these moments as our proudest achievements. But we lost all that. Or perhaps we've just forgotten that we are still pioneers. And we've barely begun. And that our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us, because our destiny lies above us."</em>
